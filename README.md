# Smart-Indicator
The major aim of this project is to reduce the overall accidents due to the lack of visibility of bikers during no-light situations. 

Suppose a road that has less load would be lightly illuminated and the streets having higher traffic would be significantly more illuminated. 
It is a Turn Signal Bike Safety Indicator designed to be wearable. It is an indicator system intended to increase a cyclistâ€™s visibility, especially at night.
